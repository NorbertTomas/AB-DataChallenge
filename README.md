This repository includes the Flowing Inequality project presented in the Aigües de Barcelona Data Challenge 2023 (https://www.abdatachallenge.cat/segona-edicio-2023/).

We presented a tool aimed at delving into socioeconomic inequality by examining water consumption patterns alongside other key socioeconomic factors in the city of Barcelona. Our tool incorporated an Inequality Index, clustering analysis, and featured a machine learning classifier that could be easily interpreted thanks to our focus in visualisation and explainability.

The project was made with my coleagues:
